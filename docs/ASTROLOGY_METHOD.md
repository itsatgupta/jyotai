# Astrology Methodology

## Initial configuration

The MVP starts with:

- Vedic/Jyotish
- Sidereal zodiac
- Lahiri ayanamsa
- Vimshottari Dasha

## Required calculation outputs

### Birth chart

- Ascendant
- Sun
- Moon
- Mars
- Mercury
- Jupiter
- Venus
- Saturn
- Rahu
- Ketu

### Derived values

- longitude
- sign
- degree
- house
- nakshatra
- pada
- retrograde
- combustion where supported
- dignity where supported
- aspects

### Task 09A derived structural facts

`jyotish-derived-facts-v1` consumes an existing canonical D1/Rashi chart and
does not calculate astronomical positions. It applies to D1 only, not D2, D9,
D10, or other Vargas. It provides structural Whole Sign rulership/lordship,
house classifications, seven-planet Graha Drishti, same-sign occupancy, and
sign-level own/exaltation/debilitation facts. It has no interpretive, predictive,
strength-scoring, Dasha, Transit, evidence, or LLM behavior.

Rahu and Ketu have no modeled ownership, dignity, or Graha Drishti in this
version. Same-sign occupancy is a symmetric structural relation, not a
conjunction-strength doctrine. Angular separation and conjunction orbs are
deferred.

### Divisional charts

Start with:

- D1
- D9
- D10
- D2

Do not implement every divisional chart in the first milestone.

## Timing

Primary:

- Mahadasha
- Antardasha
- Pratyantardasha when needed

Transits:

- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Rahu
- Ketu

## Important

The calculation library and methodology must be properly licensed for commercial use.

The exact calculation settings must be stored with each chart.
